            <p>School life is one of the most important phases in the life of a man. It is the period during which one learns the basic principles of behavior, speech, and etiquette. School life, in fact, is a period of learning and training in all the aspects of the personality of a man. One gets training for maintaining physical fitness, increasing oneâ€™s mental powers, learning the proper code of behavior and understanding the basic concepts of life. School life is a period for the formation of character, mind, and body on sound lines.</p>

                    A nutritious diet is essential to healthy brain development in children, which is critical to good learning.Our school kitchen team prepares fresh meals every day on site. As well as a range of wholesome, nutritious and delicious snacks and meals for all, the team also provides for students with special dietary needs.There is a daily morning snack, afternoon snack, and at lunchtime a soup starter and two main courses, one of each being a vegetarian option. Parents are provided with a menu in advance of each week and are able to select the food they would like their children to be served each day.

                    In the last 20 years, the Internet has grown from being nearly non-existent into the largest, most accessible database of information ever created. It has changed the way people communicate, shop, socialise, do business and think about knowledge and learning. Much more than just a new twist on distance learning, online schooling is changing the face of traditional classrooms and making education more accessible than ever before.
